## APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

This is the client-side of a survey application. It was developed by a group of three students in General Assemblyâ€™s Web Development Immersive: Julia Daly, Ryan Roderick, and Joel Buzzanco. The application allows users to create custom surveys, have others answer their surveys, and view respective answers to surveys.
